# **EGT309 AI Solution Development Project**

## Project: Determine Wine Quality
This project is a Kubernetes-based machine learning system to determine wine quality in a fully containerized enviornment with persistent storage, as well as a user-friendly web interface

## System Architecture
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans & Transform raw data
- Model Training: Trains a predictive model using Machine Learning
- Model Inference: use the trained model to make predictions
- User Interface: web application for user to interact
